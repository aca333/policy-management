/**
 * The domain boundary, enforced.
 *
 * `ADR-0000` § What we have committed to maintaining:
 *
 *   "A domain package that never imports the web framework. This will be under constant
 *    pressure and is the single most important architectural boundary in the repository."
 *
 * Under constant pressure is the operative phrase. A boundary maintained by intention
 * lasts until the first afternoon when importing the request context is the quick fix.
 * This test is what makes forgetting insufficient.
 *
 * Two invariants rest on it:
 *
 *   INV-TEN-004  tenant scoping is enforced below the presentation layer, so background
 *                jobs and APIs inherit it
 *   INV-AUTH-001 default deny, through one evaluator with no second path around it
 *
 * It is an ALLOWLIST, deliberately. A denylist of forbidden frameworks silently permits
 * the next one anybody adds, which is precisely the failure it would exist to prevent.
